# FACCINE </br> (Fast-Access Cloud-Connected Immuno-Network Exchange)
<b>The Main Issue</b>: Failure to get vaccinations stems from three major causes: distrust due to misinformation, negligence and ignorance. People forget about immunization dates and fail to stay on schedule.

<b>Our Proposed Solution</b>: We tackle this issue by syncing the user's GCal with vaccination dates, setting up communication interfaces with doctors for informing patients about the importance of certain vaccines, and videos that help debunk myths about immunization.

<b>Problem 1</b>: Combating Vaccine Hesitancy

As a young mother, I’m unsure about which vaccines are vital for my child and which ones aren’t. Does she need to have that many in such a short time?
How can I find out what to do?

Vaccine hesitancy refers to delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite availability of vaccination services. Vaccine hesitancy is complex and context specific varying across time, place and vaccines. It includes factors such as complacency, convenience and confidence.
In most cases, interventions should be dialogue based and directly targeted to a specific under-vaccinated population group.

We can: 1) Identify populations susceptible to vaccine-preventable diseases, 2) Diagnose supply- and demand-side barriers and enablers to vaccination, and 3) Recommend evidence-informed responses to build and sustain vaccination uptake.

<b>Problem 2</b>: Medication Adherence

Suggestions: Reminder system to take medication (Twilio)

<b>Problem 3</b>: Enabling Remote Healthcare

Suggestions: 1) Communication channels between patients, doctors, and providers, 2) Diet tracker/analyzer (deficiencies, surpluses), 3) Family monitoring (diet, medication, conditions, history), 4) Mini health encyclopedia

Technologies: React-Native, API Twilio, MongoDB 

Understanding the problems: laziness, unwillingness to engage, unpleasant experience, distrust, ignorance, lack of awareness or sense of urgency, cost
