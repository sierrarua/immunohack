<b>Problem</b>: Combating Vaccine Hesitancy

As a young mother, I’m unsure about which vaccines are vital for my child and which ones aren’t. Does she need to have that many in such a short time?
How can I find out what to do?

Vaccine hesitancy refers to delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite availability of vaccination services. Vaccine hesitancy is complex and context specific varying across time, place and vaccines. It includes factors such as complacency, convenience and confidence.
In most cases, interventions should be dialogue based and directly targeted to a specific under-vaccinated population group.

We can: 1) Identify populations susceptible to vaccine-preventable diseases, 2) Diagnose supply- and demand-side barriers and enablers to vaccination, and 3) Recommend evidence-informed responses to build and sustain vaccination uptake.
